			Choose a safe online name. Pick a name that doesn’t reflect your complete 
			identity or location.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			
			Have a strong password with alpha-numeric symbol and special characters for 
			your online account.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Secure your computers with anti-virus, anti-spyware and other cyber security 
			tools.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Be selective about what information you make public. Be cautious while 
			posting online any information that can personally identify you, a family 
			member, or friend on a public site like a blog, or online white pages, or 
			job hunt sites, or in any other place. Anyone on the Internet can see the 
			information. Sensitive information includes real name, date of birth, 
			gender, town, e-mail address, school name, place of work, and personal 
			photos. Fraudsters, cheats and online perverts can misuse this information 
			to your detriment</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Pay attention to the risks associated with e-mails. and think twice before 
			you open attachments or click links in e-mail- even 
			if you know the sender -as 
			these can be used to transmit spam and viruses to your computer. Never 
			respond to e-mail asking you to provide personal information, especially 
			your account number or password, even if it seems to be from a business you 
			trust.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Never, try to meet a person with whom you’ve interacted only online without 
			taking somebody else along and such meeting must always be in a public 
			place. Remember, people are not always who they say they are. People often 
			feel uncomfortable setting safety boundaries because they don’t want to 
			offend someone; but good intentioned people will understand and encourage 
			you to set safety requirements, and it is the crooks who want you to feel 
			guilty about it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Periodically review your internet contacts and online activities. Internet 
			housekeeping is important. Periodically review who you have as contacts, and 
			who can see your online profiles periodically to prune out everyone you no 
			longer have a close interaction with. Review images and content you’ve 
			posted online to see if collectively these tell more about you than what 
			should be known.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			
			Block people you don’t want to interact with. You don’t have to accept 
			invitations to be friends with people just because they ask. People can find 
			it difficult to turn someone down – and creeps and crooks count on this very 
			thing. If you don’t want to be friends, delete the request. If you are 
			already connected with someone you would rather not be, block them from your 
			social sites. You can also block their email account so that they can never 
			contact you through email, and block their phone number from calling or 
			sending text messages to your phone. YOU get to choose who, how, and when 
			you are contacted.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Note that if you become a victim of a cybe crime, it is not your fault. If 
			you fall victim to a scam, fraudster, abuser or criminal, don’t blame 
			yourself. The only person guilty is the abuser or a criminal. You didn’t 
			cheat, scam, lie, threaten, harm, steal, or abuse yourself in some other 
			way, so don’t lay a burden of guilt. Don’t let the abuser or the criminal 
			shame you into silence. Speak out and get the help you need.</span></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Don’t share your password with anyone or let anybody else 
			handle your account. What is seen as trust or some harmless fun, can have 
			severe consequences.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Ensure your computer has a good antivirus and anti spyware software. A lot 
			of applications on social networking sites can be malicious, and if your 
			computer is not well protected, it can result in a lot of issues.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Last, but not the least, trust your instinct. If you are being subjected to 
			any form of cyber bullying or harassment, report it at once!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Always keep your devise (Phone, Tablet, Laptop etc.) in safe custody. Keep 
			your lock screen on with Password/Pin protection. Don’t keep you device 
			unattended even for a minute.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Note: Information posted online can never be completely removed. So, apply 
			caution while sharing anything online.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Note: The online audience is much larger than we comprehend. Anything 
			offensive or embarrassing, has a higher chance of become viral And out of 
			control. Apply caution while posting things other people.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Don’t post personal information such as mobile numbers and personal email 
			ids on social networking sites.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="auto-style3">
			Be extremely cautious while posting photographs and control who can view 
			them. Bear in mind that photos can be saved and altered – you don’t want to 
			regret having posted a particular photo, at a later stage! Create restricted 
			user groups who can view photos. Also, don’t post embarrassing pictures of 
			others.</p>
